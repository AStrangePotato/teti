### NEW!!!

I have tried my best to organise all the code into files and classes for the chance someone wants to use this code, and for adding more features

(but no longer 1000 lines of code sadge)

## Desktop App
All the information is in the tauri branch, can download in releases

Probably won't keep up to date

## Feature Wishlist

May implement these in the future (no particular order):
- undo/redo
- edit board tiles (add garb line feature with hole, show mino preview, add colours)
- custom game
- guide like progression thing? using custom boards (kinda like tetris tres bien)
- title screen maybe
- more unique gamemodes (techmino styled)
- more stats + customise stat sidebar
- more garbage settings
- maybe play around with server api stuff, like adding a leaderboard or connecting tetrio stats
- allow importing tetrio settings and custom game files
- replay functionality (either save gamestate or save keystrokes idk yet)
- finesse detection
- pb logging
- custom mino skins and music
- touch settings
- cooler graphics (maybe using a library like pixijs)
- more rotation systems (ars, trs, srs/srsX, none)
